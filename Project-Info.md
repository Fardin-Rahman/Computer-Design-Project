# Computer-Design-Project
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in the field of computer graphics. It is known for its simplicity and versatility, making it a great choice for creating graphics projects of all kinds. With its powerful libraries and frameworks, such as PyOpenGL and Pygame.

This is a football penalty shoot game build for computer graphics project. Here user gives horizental slot choise in range and height value in range to shoot the ball. After shooting the ball the goal gets counted if it is not catched by the goalkeeper and on scoreboard the result changes accordingly.

The win gets decided on the maximum number of goals out of 5, otherwsie he looses.

Algorithms:
-Midpoint line draw algorithms
-Midpoint circle draw algorithms
-Transformation
-Scaling
-Rotation



Libraries: Numpy, OpenGL, Random, Time


Key features:<br>
Takes ball shot positioning from the user.
Generates random movement of goalkeepers.
Instantly updates the scoreboard.
Scales the ball from view angle.
Shows the result after gameover.
